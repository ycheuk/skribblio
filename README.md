## 👩🏻‍💻 DESCRIPTION
Welcome to `skribbl.io 🎨`, a digital rendition of the classic game of pictionary, where players utilize a chatroom to guess answers and control gameplay. This project was heavily inspired by the popular online game, [**skribbl.io**](https://skribbl.io/).

`skribbl.io` was made by [@00eemsy](https://github.com/00eemsy) (emily) and [@ycheuk](https://github.com/ycheuk) (yikyin) as part of our 2024 reed hackathon. This hackathon acted as an introduction to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, web development, client-server interactions, etc., and `skribbl.io` was the capstone of our week-long learning experience!

This game was created with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, with the help of runtime environments/frameworks/etc. such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) for our backend

<img src="./visuals/help.png" height=750>
* Type commands directly into the chatbox
* After starting a round (with the `start` command)
  * The chat will choose a random player as that round's drawer and will give them a keyword to draw out
  * Using the canvas's different pen colors and widths, the drawer will be given 1 minute to draw out their keyword
  * Using the chat, other players will type their guesses into the chat
  * The first one to guess the word gets a point added to their score!
  * If no one guesses it, the round is null and no one gains a point
